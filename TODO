* If gravitational acceleration is too small and distance from COM is too large, delete object from the map

* Velocity panel

* Trail Spacing as a function of velocity, i.e. lower velocity so more trail spacing, higher velocity gives
  less trail spacing. (Smooth trails?)

* Togglable grid lines

* Select Planets via clicking on them

* Fix sortEnabled problem

* Cubic interpolation between trail points?

* Saving Simulations

* Playback

* Arbitrary (not defined in code) simulations

* Velocity/Acceleration Vectors

* Remove self-relative data
